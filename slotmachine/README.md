## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Users start with 100 and can bet a min or max bet of 1 dollar or 25 dollars. Winning the minimum bet will reward 25 dollars and the maximum bet will reward 250 dollars. There are 3 reels, each reel has 5 options which will appear randomly but all need to end up matching in order to win. The odds are 1 in 25.

## Lessons Learned:

During the construction of this web application I learned how to use Math.random in order to generate random rolls for the reels as well as keep a running total of the amount of money the user has left.
